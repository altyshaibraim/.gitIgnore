    /*                     The main concepts behind the Github flow are:

    -Anything in the master branch is deployable.
    -To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of master (feature branches)
    -Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to remote the same named branch.
    -When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request.
    -After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can merge it into master.
    -Once it is merged and pushed to ‘master’, you can and should deploy immediately.
