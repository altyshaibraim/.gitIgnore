        right click on selected file or folder -> Git -> Add to .gitignore -> Add to .gitignore -> Add
        !!! After you enabled ignore function, there is a new file created .gitignore. It contains the list of files
                                                                                                   that are ignored.

                               To manually enable ignore function after .gitignore file was created:
        In .gitignore file type /file name/
        !!! On IntelliJ color of a file or folder means following:
                                                        green -> untracked; beige -> ignored

                               To unastage the file/folder OR to fix ignored file/folder:
        Commit -> check tracked file/folder OR uncheck ignored file/folder -> right click on selected file/folder ->
                                                                                                         -> Rollback
         */
    }
